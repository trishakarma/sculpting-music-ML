# sculpting-music-ML
ML computer vision project inspired by Imogen Heap's Mi.Mu gloves that offers a gesture-controlled audio processing system. Making a fist enables the autotune+reverb "robotic" effect, while an open palm preserves your natural voice. Built using MediaPipe for high-fidelity hand tracking; PSOLA, Librosa, and PyAudio for audio processing.

To try for yourself, install dependencies (pyaudio librosa psola mediapipe opencv numpy) ; run Main.py ; experiment with the app and save output by pressing the "s" key
